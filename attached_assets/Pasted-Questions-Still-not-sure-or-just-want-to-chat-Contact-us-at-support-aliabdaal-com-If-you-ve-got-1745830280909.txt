Welcome! 

If youâ€™re watching this, you probably want to learn more about YouTube, and whether youâ€™re a beginner, intermediate, advanced, or simply a business owner looking to start out, my names Luke, I can help you. 

Iâ€™ve been learning from, and working with, some of the biggest YouTubers in the macroeconomic space since 2021, helping them growâ€¦
Then, to prove that I could walk the walk, and my strategies could work for anyone, I started making YouTube videos more regularly myself at the beginning of 2024, and have since grown 2 different YouTube channels from 0 to 15,000 subscribers in under 12 months, all while juggling the 15 clients I consult for, and travelling to over 20 different cities, and filming in shitty air BNBs like this one with no expensive microphone, professional camera, andâ€¦

To be frank, some cheap, cost effective editing

Once you know the secrets of the YouTube Algorithmâ€¦ it matters less what your backdrop looks like, and more about the message you deliver. 

I was lucky enough to learn these secrets and become obsessed with Youtube while working with one of the best in the business, Mark Moss.

For 2 years, between 2021 and 2022 I was fortunate enough to be hand-trained to write newsletters, emails, funnel campaigns, YouTube scripts, and everything related to YouTube and marketing.
I was lucky enough to get a behind-the-scenes masterclass on how to build and manage a social media presence, from someone who has built 8 seven figure companies, and has over 450,000 subscribers on YouTube, and over 120,000 followers on Twitter. 
Annnnddd I even got to meet some cool people like Mike Tysonâ€¦(Find video)

The takeaway from my experience in those 2 years is actually pretty simpleâ€¦

YouTube only cares about 3 simple things.

Does someone CLICK on the video
How much do they watch?
Will they watch more of your content?

If itâ€™s that simple, doesnâ€™t everyone do this?

This couldnâ€™t possibly work could it?

Obviously thereâ€™s a little more to it that just this as you guys will see, but overall, itâ€™s not that hard. 

Now I wish I had someone who taught me this when I was starting out.

So Iâ€™m going to condense down my 4 years of learning into 30 minutes of videos
